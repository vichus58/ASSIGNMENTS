		<h1>COMPUTER</h1>
		<A href="#topper">GOTO TOP</a><br><br>
		A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. 
		Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed: the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	<div id="cpu">
		<b>CPU</b><br>
		A central processing unit (CPU): also referred to as a central processor unit:is the hardware within a computer that 
		carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical:
		logical: and input-"output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industiy at least since 
		the early 1960s.The form: desigl: and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history: but their 
		fundamental operation remains much the same.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	<div id="alu">
		<b>ALU</b><br>
		In computing: an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer:
		and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside 
		modern CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) accommodate  powerful and complex ALUs; a single component may contain a
		number of ALUs.
		<br>
	</div>
	
	<div id="pl">
		<h1>Programming Language</h1>
		<A href="">GOTO TOP</a><br><br>
		A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, 
		particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of 
		a machine or to express algorithms.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	<div id="c">
		<b>C</b><br>
		C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler,
		to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, 
		and to require minimal run-time support. Therefore, C was useful for many applications that had formerly been coded 
		in assembly language, for example in system programming.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	
	<div id="cpp">
		<b>C++</b><br>
		It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with 
		performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[5] C++ has also been found useful in many
		other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,

		<h1>DBMS</h1>
		<A href="">GOTO TOP</a><br><br>
		
		<br>
	</div>
	
	
	<div id="rdbms">
		<b>RDBMS</b><br>
		RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and 
		Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is 
		based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	
	<div id="oodbms">
		<b>OODBMS</b><br>
		An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and 
		modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties,
		and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.
		<br><br>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div id="hdbms">
		<b>HDBMS</b><br>
		A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply 
		represents the data using parent â€“ child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still 
		some organizations are using this.
